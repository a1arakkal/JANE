# Description

**JANE** is an R package for fitting latent space network cluster models using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. It enables flexible modeling of unweighted or weighted network data, with or without noise edges, and supports both directed and undirected networks, with or without degree or strength heterogeneity. Designed to efficiently handle large networks, **JANE** allows users to explore latent structure, identify actor-centric communities, and simulate networks with customizable clustering and connectivity patterns.

Details on the methodology underlying the package can be found in @JANE.

# Fitting **JANE** on networks *without* noise edges

When the `noise_weights` argument in `JANE()` is set to `FALSE` (default), a standard latent space cluster model is fit to the supplied network. 

## Available models

### `model = "NDH"`

Applicable for undirected networks and assumes no degree heterogeneity. Below is an example that fits an NDH model, specifying the dimension of the latent space as 2 and the number of clusters as 3.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
     D = 2L,
     K = 3L,
     model = "NDH",
     noise_weights = FALSE)
```

### `model = "RS"`

Applicable for undirected networks and adjusts for degree heterogeneity through the inclusion of actor-specific sociality effects. Below is an example that fits an RS model, where the number of clusters is specified to be 3 and a range of dimensions between 2 and 5 for the latent space is considered.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
     D = 2:5,
     K = 3L,
     model = "RS",
     noise_weights = FALSE)
```

### `model = "RSR"`

Applicable for directed networks and adjusts for degree heterogeneity through the inclusion of actor-specific sender and receiver effects. Below is an example that fits an RSR model, where a range of cluster numbers between 2 and 10 and a range of dimensions between 2 and 5 for the latent space is considered.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
     D = 2:5,
     K = 2:10,
     model = "RSR",
     noise_weights = FALSE)
```

# Fitting **JANE** on networks *with* noise edges

A weighted networks are particularly useful in settings where noise edges are present. In such settings, when the `noise_weights` argument in `JANE()` is set to `TRUE`, a latent space hurdle model if fit that leverages information from both the propoensity to form and edge and the observed edge weights to probabilistically down-weight noisy edges, while preserving edges that are structurally meaningful, subsequently enhancing community detection.

If the supplied network is a weighted network, in the absence of noise it can be shown that, the latent positions, regression parameters associated with the logistic regression model, finite mixture model parameters, and actor-specific cluster membership probabilities can all be estimated separately from the parameters generalized linear model parameters for the edge weights. Thus, when `noise_weights = FALSE`, `JANE()` will simply dichotomize the weighted network based on a threshold value of 0 and fit a standard latent space cluster model.

## Available models

You can fit the `"NDH"`, `"RS"`, or `"RSR"` models using any of the supported weight distributions described below. When working with weighted networks, the `"RS"` and `"RSR"` models account not only for degree heterogeneity but also for strength heterogeneity.

### `family = "poisson"`

Use this option for count-weighted networks. This setting models observed edge weights using a zero-truncated Poisson (ZTP) distribution:

-  Signal edge weights are modeled with a ZTP using a log link
-  Noise edge weights are modeled with a ZTP using a fixed user-specified mean via the `guess_noise_weights` argument

```{r, eval = FALSE}
JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
     D = 2,
     K = 5,
     model = "NDH",
     noise_weights = TRUE,
     family = "poisson",
     guess_noise_weights = 1L)
```

### `family = "lognormal"`

Use this setting when edge weights are positive, continuous values. Here:

-  Signal edges are modeled using a log-normal distribution with an identity link
-  Noise edge weights are modeled using a log-normal distribution with a user-specified log-scale mean via the `guess_noise_weights` argument

```{r, eval = FALSE}
JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
     D = 2,
     K = 5,
     model = "RS",
     noise_weights = TRUE
     family = "lognormal",
     guess_noise_weights = -3.5) # log-scale mean
```

### `family = "bernoulli"` (default)

This setting is used for unweighted (binary) networks. In this case:

-  Signal and noise edges share the same observed weight (i.e., 1), so only the edge propensity model is used to identify and down-weight likely noise edges
-  `guess_noise_weights` is interpreted as the expected proportion of all edges that are likely to be noise

```{r, eval = FALSE}
JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
     D = 2,
     K = 5,
     model = "NDH",
     noise_weights = TRUE
     family = "bernoulli",
     guess_noise_weights = 0.2) # expected noise edge proportion
```

## `guess_noise_weights`

If guess_noise_weights is left as NULL (the default), `JANE()` will automatically set this value based on the distribution family:

-  For `family %in% c("lognormal", "poisson")`, the 1st percentile of the non-zero edge weights is used
-  For `family = "bernoulli"`, a default value of 0.01 (i.e., 1%) is used, representing the assumed proportion of noisy edges.

# Simulating networks

**JANE** includes a built-in function, `sim_A()`, for simulating networks with varying clustering and connectivity patterns. The function returns a list, which includes the following two components:

- `A`: A sparse adjacency matrix of class 'dgCMatrix' representing the "true" underlying unweighted network with no noise edges
- `W`: A sparse adjacency matrix of class 'dgCMatrix' representing the unweighted or weighted network, with or without noise.

The relationship between `A` and `W` depends on the values specified for `family` and `noise_weights_prob`:

- If `family = "bernoulli"` and `noise_weights_prob = 0`, then `A` and `W` are identical (i.e., no noise simulated).
- If `family = "bernoulli"` and `noise_weights_prob > 0`, then `W` contains added noise edges, while `A` represents the noise-free underlying network.
- If `family %in% c("poisson", "lognormal")` and `noise_weights_prob = 0`, then `W` contains continuous or count-valued edge weights, but dichotomizing `W` at 0 will reproduce `A`.
- If `family %in% c("poisson", "lognormal")` and `noise_weights_prob > 0`, then `W` is a noisy, weighted network with additional spurious edges, and `A` remains the true underlying structure.

Below is an example to simulate an unweighted, undirected, noise-free network with a 2-dimensional latent space and 3 clusters.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Specify the 3 x 2 matrix containing the 2 x 1 mean vectors of the 3 bivariate normals
mus <- matrix(c(-1,-1,  # Mean vector 1
                 1,-1,  # Mean vector 2
                 1, 1), # Mean vector 3
              nrow = 3,
              ncol = 2, 
              byrow = TRUE)

# Specify the 2 x 2 x 3 array containing the 2 x 2 precision matrices of the 3 bivariate normals
omegas <- array(c(diag(rep(7,2)),  # Precision matrix 1
                  diag(rep(7,2)),  # Precision matrix 2
                  diag(rep(7,2))), # Precision matrix 3
                  dim = c(2,2,3))

# Simulate a network
sim_data <- sim_A(N = 100L, 
                  model = "NDH",
                  mus = mus, 
                  omegas = omegas, 
                  p = rep(1/3, 3), 
                  params_LR = list(beta0 = 1.0),
                  remove_isolates = TRUE)
```

The parameter `beta0` can be tuned to achieve a desired network denisty:

```{r, eval = !identical(Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN"), "true"), message=FALSE}
# Specify the 3 x 2 matrix containing the 2 x 1 mean vectors of the 3 bivariate normals
mus <- matrix(c(-1,-1,  # Mean vector 1
                 1,-1,  # Mean vector 2
                 1, 1), # Mean vector 3
              nrow = 3,
              ncol = 2, 
              byrow = TRUE)

# Specify the 2 x 2 x 3 array containing the 2 x 2 precision matrices of the 3 bivariate normals
omegas <- array(c(diag(rep(7,2)),  # Precision matrix 1
                  diag(rep(7,2)),  # Precision matrix 2
                  diag(rep(7,2))), # Precision matrix 3
                  dim = c(2,2,3))

desired_density <- 0.1 # Target network density
min_density <- desired_density * 0.99  # Lower bound for acceptable density
max_density <- desired_density * 1.01  # Upper bound for acceptable density
n_act <- 100L # Number of actors in the network

density <- Inf # Initialize density to enter while loop
beta0 <- 0.5 # Initial value for intercept parameter
n_while_loop <- 0 # Counter for outer loop iterations
max_its <- 100 # Maximum number of iterations
change_beta0 <- 0.1  # Amount to adjust beta0 by

# Adjust beta0 until simulated network has approximately desired density
while(! (density >= min_density & density <= max_density) ){
  
  if(n_while_loop>max_its){
    break
  }
  
  n_retry_isolate <- 0
  retry_isolate <- T
  
  # Retry until a network with no isolates is generated
  while(retry_isolate){
    
    sim_data <- sim_A(N = n_act, 
                      model = "NDH",
                      mus = mus, 
                      omegas = omegas, 
                      p = rep(1/3, 3), 
                      params_LR = list(beta0 = beta0),
                      remove_isolates = TRUE)
    
    n_retry_isolate <- n_retry_isolate + 1
    
    # Accept network if no isolates remain, or if retried more than 10 times at the same beta0
    if(nrow(sim_data$A) == n_act | n_retry_isolate>10){
      retry_isolate <- F
    }
    
  }
  
  # Compute network density
  density <- igraph::graph.density(
    igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(sim_data$A, mode = "undirected")
    )

  # Adjust beta0 based on density feedback
  if (density > max_density)  {
    beta0 <- beta0 - change_beta0
  }
  
  if (density < min_density)  {
    beta0 <- beta0 + change_beta0
  }
  
  n_while_loop <- n_while_loop + 1
  
}    

A <- sim_data$A # Final simulated adjacency matrix
igraph::graph.density(igraph::graph_from_adjacency_matrix(A, mode = "undirected"))
```

Below is an example that simulates a directed, weighted network with noise, degree and strength heterogeneity, a 2-dimensional latent space, and 3 clusters.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Specify the 3 x 2 matrix containing the 2 x 1 mean vectors of the 3 bivariate normals
mus <- matrix(c(-1,-1,  # Mean vector 1
                 1,-1,  # Mean vector 2
                 1, 1), # Mean vector 3
              nrow = 3,
              ncol = 2, 
              byrow = TRUE)

# Specify the 2 x 2 x 3 array containing the 2 x 2 precision matrices of the 3 bivariate normals
omegas <- array(c(diag(rep(7,2)),  # Precision matrix 1
                  diag(rep(7,2)),  # Precision matrix 2
                  diag(rep(7,2))), # Precision matrix 3
                  dim = c(2,2,3))

# Simulate a network
JANE::sim_A(N = 100L, 
            model = "RSR",
            family = "poisson",
            mus = mus, 
            omegas = omegas, 
            p = rep(1/3, 3), 
            params_LR = list(beta0 = 1),
            params_weights = list(beta0 = 2),
            noise_weights_prob = 0.1,
            mean_noise_weights = 1,
            remove_isolates = TRUE)
```

# Model selection criteria for choosing the number of clusters

`JANE()` allows for the following model selection criteria to choose the number of clusters and the best initalization of the EM algorithm (smaller values are favored):

- `"Total_BIC"`: Sum of $BIC_{model}$ and $BIC_{mbc}$, where $BIC_{model}$ is the BIC computed from logistic regression or Hurdle model component and $BIC_{mbc}$ is the BIC computed from model based clustering component. This is the model selection criterion proposed by @handcock2007model.
- `"Total_ICL"`: (default) sum of $BIC_{model}$ and $ICL_{mbc}$, this criterion is similar to `"Total_BIC"`, but uses the integrated complete likelihood (ICL) for the model based clustering component, which tends to favor more well-separated clusters.

Based on simulation studies, @ICL recommends that when the interest in mixture modeling is cluster analysis, instead of density estimation, the $ICL_{mbc}$ criterion should be favored over the $BIC_{mbc}$ criterion, as the $BIC_{mbc}$ criterion tends to overestimate the number of clusters. The $BIC_{mbc}$ criterion is designed to choose the number of components in a mixture model rather than the number of clusters.

***Warning***: It is not certain whether it is appropriate to use the model selection criterion above to select the dimension of the latent space $D$.

Below is an example that fits an RSR model, where a range of cluster numbers between 2 and 10 is considered for a 2-dimensional the latent space and `"Total_BIC"` is used to select the optimal number of clusters and best initialization of the EM algorithm.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
     D = 2,
     K = 2:10,
     model = "RSR",
     noise_weights = FALSE,
     control = list(IC_selection = "Total_BIC"))
```

Below is an example that fits an RSR model, for a 2-dimensional the latent space with 3 clusters and `"Total_ICL"` is used to select the optimal initialization of the EM algorithm.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
     D = 2,
     K = 3,
     model = "RSR",
     noise_weights = FALSE,
     control = list(IC_selection = "Total_ICL"))
```

# Initialization of EM-algorithm

`JANE()` has three initialization strategies to generate starting values for the EM algorthm, controlled throught the `initialization` argument:

-  `"GNN"`: uses a type of graphical neural network approach to generate initial values (default)
-  `"random"`: uses random initial values
-  A user-supplied list of S3 class `"JANE.initial_values"` representing initial values for the EM algorithm. See `?specify_initial_values` for details on how to specify initial values

Details of the graphical neural network approach can be found in @JANE.

Below is an example where starting values are supplied to `JANE()` using `specify_initial_values()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Specify starting values
D <- 3L
K <- 5L
N <- nrow(sim_data$A)
n_interior_knots <- 5L
U <- matrix(stats::rnorm(N*D), nrow = N, ncol = D)
omegas <- stats::rWishart(n = K, df = D+1, Sigma = diag(D))
mus <- matrix(stats::rnorm(K*D), nrow = K, ncol = D)
p <- extraDistr::rdirichlet(n = 1, rep(3,K))[1,]
Z <-  extraDistr::rdirichlet(n = N, alpha = rep(1, K))
beta <- stats::rnorm(n = 1 + 2*(1 + n_interior_knots))

my_starting_values <- JANE::specify_initial_values(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
                                                   D = D,
                                                   K = K,
                                                   model = "RSR",
                                                   n_interior_knots = n_interior_knots,
                                                   U = U,
                                                   omegas = omegas, 
                                                   mus = mus, 
                                                   p = p, 
                                                   Z = Z,
                                                   beta = beta)         

# Run JANE using my_starting_values (no need to specify D and K as function will 
# determine those values from my_starting_values)
JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
     initialization = my_starting_values,
     model = "RSR",
     noise_weights = FALSE)
```

# Specification of prior hyperparameters

## Prior distributions

The prior distributions are specified as follows:

### Prior on $\boldsymbol{\mu}_k$ and $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_k$

The same prior is used for $k = 1, \ldots, K$:

\[
\boldsymbol{\Omega}_k \sim \text{Wishart}(c, \boldsymbol{G}^{-1})
\]

\[
\boldsymbol{\mu}_k \mid \boldsymbol{\Omega}_k \sim \text{MVN}(\boldsymbol{a}, (b \boldsymbol{\Omega}_k)^{-1})
\]

### Prior on $\boldsymbol{p}$

For the current implementation, we require that all elements of the `nu` vector be $\geq 1$ to prevent negative mixture weights for empty clusters:

\[
\boldsymbol{p} \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\nu_1, \ldots, \nu_K)
\]


### Prior on $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{LR}$

\[
\boldsymbol{\beta}_{LR} \sim \text{MVN}(\boldsymbol{e}, \boldsymbol{F}^{-1})
\]

### Prior on $q$

\[
q \sim \text{Beta}(h, l)
\]


### *Zero-truncated Poisson*

#### Prior on $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{GLM}$

\[
\boldsymbol{\beta}_{GLM} \sim \text{MVN}(\boldsymbol{e}_2, \boldsymbol{F}_2^{-1})
\]

### *Log-normal*

#### Prior on $\tau^2_{\text{weights}}$

\[
\tau^2_{\text{weights}} \sim \text{Gamma}\left(\frac{m_1}{2}, \frac{o_1}{2}\right)
\]

#### Prior on $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{GLM}$

\[
\boldsymbol{\beta}_{GLM} \mid \tau^2_{\text{weights}} \sim \text{MVN}\left(\boldsymbol{e}_2, (\tau^2_{\text{weights}} \boldsymbol{F}_2)^{-1}\right)
\]

#### Prior on $\tau^2_{\text{noise weights}}$

\[
\tau^2_{\text{noise weights}} \sim \text{Gamma}\left(\frac{m_2}{2}, \frac{o_2}{2}\right)
\]


### Default hyperparameters

-  $\boldsymbol{a} = \boldsymbol{0}_D$
-  $b = 1$
-  $c = D+1$
-  $\boldsymbol{e} = \boldsymbol{0}_{dim(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{LR})}$
-  $\boldsymbol{e}_2 = \boldsymbol{0}_{dim(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{GLM})}$
-  $\boldsymbol{F} = \text{Diag}(1/100, (1/2.5^2)\mathbf{1}_{dim(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{LR})})$
-  $\boldsymbol{F}_2 = \text{Diag}(1/100, (1/2.5^2)\mathbf{1}_{dim(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{GLM})})$
-  $\boldsymbol{G} = \mathbf{I}_D$
-  $h = l =1$
-  $m_1 = m_2 = o_1 = o_2 = 2$
-  $\boldsymbol{\nu} = 3\mathbf{1}_{K}$

where, $D$ is the dimension of the latent space, $K$ is the number of clusters, $$dim(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{LR}) = dim(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{GLM}) = \begin{cases}0 & \text{"NDH''}\\ \zeta+1 &  \text{"RS''} \\ 2\zeta+2 & \text{"RSR''},\end{cases}$$ and $\zeta$ is the number of interior knots used in fitting a natural cubic spline for degree heterogeneity (and connection strength heterogeneity if working with weighted network) models (i.e., `"RS"` and `"RSR"` only).

## Example of specifying hyperparameters for a single combination of $K$ and $D$

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Specify prior hyperparameters
D <- 3L
K <- 5L
n_interior_knots <- 5L
a <- rep(1, D)
b <- 3
c <- 4
G <- 10*diag(D)
nu <- rep(2, K)
e <- rep(0.5, 1 + (n_interior_knots + 1))
f <- diag(c(0.1, rep(0.5, n_interior_knots + 1)))

my_prior_hyperparameters <- specify_priors(D = D,
                                           K = K,
                                           model = "RS",
                                           n_interior_knots = n_interior_knots,

## Example of specifying hyperparameters for a multiple combinations of $K$ and $D$

### Nested list

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Specify first set of prior hyperparameters
D <- 3L
K <- 5L
n_interior_knots <- 5L
a <- rep(1, D)
b <- 3
c <- 4
G <- 10*diag(D)
nu <- rep(2, K)
e <- rep(0.5, 1 + (n_interior_knots + 1))
f <- diag(c(0.1, rep(0.5, n_interior_knots + 1)))

my_prior_hyperparameters_1 <- specify_priors(D = D,
                                             K = K,
                                             model = "RS",
                                             n_interior_knots = n_interior_knots,
                                             a = a,
                                             b = b,
                                             c = c,
                                             G = G,
                                             nu = nu,
                                             e = e,
                                             f = f)

# Specify second set of prior hyperparameters
D <- 2L
K <- 3L
n_interior_knots <- 5L
a <- rep(1, D)
b <- 3
c <- 4
G <- 10*diag(D)
nu <- rep(2, K)
e <- rep(0.5, 1 + (n_interior_knots + 1))
f <- diag(c(0.1, rep(0.5, n_interior_knots + 1)))

my_prior_hyperparameters_2 <- specify_priors(D = D,
                                             K = K,
                                             model = "RS",
                                             n_interior_knots = n_interior_knots,
                                             a = a,
                                             b = b,
                                             c = c,
                                             G = G,
                                             nu = nu,
                                             e = e,
                                             f = f)

# Create nested list
my_prior_hyperparameters <- list(my_prior_hyperparameters_1,
                                 my_prior_hyperparameters_2)

# Run JANE on simulated data using supplied prior hyperparameters (no need to 
# specify D and K as function will determine those values from my_prior_hyperparameters)
res <- JANE::JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
                  initialization = "GNN",
                  model = "RS",
                  noise_weights = FALSE,
                  control = list(priors = my_prior_hyperparameters))
```

### Unevaluated calls

Unevaluated calls using `quote()` can be supplied as values for specific hyperparameters. This is particularly useful when running `JANE()` for multiple combinations of $K$ and $D$.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Specify prior hyperparameters as unevaluated calls
n_interior_knots <- 5L
e <- rep(0.5, 1 + (n_interior_knots + 1))
f <- diag(c(0.1, rep(0.5, n_interior_knots + 1)))
my_prior_hyperparameters <- specify_priors(model = "RS",
                                           n_interior_knots = n_interior_knots,
                                           a = quote(rep(1, D)),
                                           b = b,
                                           c = quote(D + 1),
                                           G = quote(10*diag(D)),
                                           nu = quote(rep(2, K)),
                                           e = e,
                                           f = f)
                                           
# Run JANE on simulated data using supplied prior hyperparameters
res <- JANE::JANE(A = sim_data$A,
                  D = 2:5,
                  K = 2:10,
                  initialization = "GNN",
                  model = "RS",
                  noise_weights = FALSE,
                  control = list(priors = my_prior_hyperparameters))
```

# Parallel implementation of **JANE**

You can speed up fitting models for multiple combinations of cluster number `K`, latent space dimension `D`, and number of initializations of the EM algorithm `n_start`, by running `JANE()` in parallel. This leverages the `future` and `future.apply` packages to distribute computation across cores.

Below is an example using 5 parallel workers to run `JANE()` with parallel backend enabled, followed by resetting to sequential processing.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Set up parallel plan with 5 workers (cores)
future::plan(future::multisession, workers = 5)

# Run JANE in parallel 
res_parallel <- JANE::JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
                           D = 2:5,
                           K = 3:10,
                           initialization = "GNN",
                           model = "RSR")

# Reset to sequential processing.
future::plan(future::sequential)
```

# Case-control implementation of **JANE**

When working with large *sparse* networks, the case-control approximation implemented in `JANE()` can reduce computational cost. This approach leverages approximation methods developed by [@Raftery2012]. The implementation in `JANE()` samples a fixed number of non-links (i.e., "controls") for each actor instead of considering all possible non-links, thereby improving scalability.

Below is an example running `JANE()` with the case-control approach, sampling 20 controls per actor.

```{r eval=FALSE}
res_case_control <- JANE::JANE(A = network_adjacency_matrix,
                               D = 2L,
                               K = 3L,
                               initialization = "GNN",
                               model = "RSR",
                               case_control = TRUE,
                               control = list(n_control = 20))
```

# Using S3 methods with **JANE** objects

Once you have fit a model using the `JANE()` function, you can inspect and analyze the results using several built-in S3 methods. These methods work with the `JANE` S3 class object returned from a model fit.

For the examples in this section, we assume that `res` is the object returned by `JANE()`.

## `print()`

The `print()` method gives a summary of the optimal model fit and available components.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
print(res)
```

This displays: 

- The model type, number of clusters, and latent space dimension 
- Sizes of each cluster, that are estimated using a hard cluster assignment rule defined as $\{h | \hat{Z}^{U}_{ih} = max_k \hat{Z}^{U}_{ik}\}$, where $\hat{Z}^{U}_{ik}$ is the estimated conditional probability that the $i^{th}$ actor belongs to the $k^{th}$ cluster. Note, here the optimal number of clusters selected may include empty clusters based on the hard cluster assignments 
- Available components in the fitted object `res` 

## `summary()`

Use the`summary()` method to extract and display detailed information about the estimated model.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summary(res)
```

You can also compare estiamted clusters assignments to known true assigments using the `true_labels` argument, or inspect starting values using `initial_values = TRUE`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summary(res, true_labels = true_labels_vec)
summary(res, initial_values = TRUE)
```

Output includes:

-   Coefficients from logistic or GLM components
-   Latent positions, cluster means, and precision matrices
-   Soft cluster memberships and hard cluster assignments
-   Clustering uncertainty
-   ARI, NMI, classification error rate (if `true_labels` is supplied)
-   Model selection criteria (BIC, ICL)
-   Summary of noise edges if `noise_weights = TRUE`. This includes the estimated conditional probability that a specific edge is a noise or a non-noise edge, and their corresponding noise-edge cluster assignment based on a hard clustering rule of $\{h | \hat{Z}^{W}_{eh} = max(\hat{Z}^{W}_{e1}, \hat{Z}^{W}_{e2})\}$ for $e = 1\dots,|E|$, where $\hat{Z}^{W}_{e1}$ and $\hat{Z}^{W}_{e2}$ are the estimated conditional probabilities that the $e^{th}$ edge is a non-noise and noise edge, respectively, and $|E|$ represents the total number of edges in the network (for undirected networks, only the upper diagonal edges are retained). Noise-edge cluster are defined as: 1 = non-noise edge and 2 = noise edge

## `plot()`:

The `plot()` method provides visualizations depending on the 'type' argument.

### Latent Space Clustering (default `type = "lsnc"`)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(res)
```

-   Plots latent positions colored by cluster
-   Ellipses show the fitted Gaussian components when $D$ = 2. When $D$ > 2, pairwise plots of the dimensions are displayed instead.

### Misclassified Actors (`type = "misclassified"`)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(res, type = "misclassified", true_labels = true_labels_vec)
```

-   Highlights misclassified actors in black based on supplied true cluster assignments (i.e., `true_labels_vec` in this example)

### Clustering Uncertainty (`type = "uncertainty"`)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(res, type = "uncertainty")
```

-   Colors nodes by uncertainty (i.e., 1 - $\hat{Z}^{U}_{ik}$)

### EM Trace Plot (`type = "trace_plot"`)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(res, type = "trace_plot")
```

-   Shows convergence metrics over EM iterations.

### Additional options

-   `alpha_edge`, `alpha_node`, `zoom`, `swap_axes`, `rotation_angle`, `zoom`, etc.
-   When `noise_weights=TRUE`, `remove_noise_edges = TRUE` removes noise edges based on noise-edge cluster assignment
