Description: Fit and simulate latent space network cluster models using an 
	expectation-maximization algorithm. Enables flexible modeling of unweighted or weighted
	network data (with or without noise edges), supporting both directed and undirected 
	networks (with or without degree heterogeneity). Designed to handle large networks 
	efficiently, it allows users to explore network structure through latent space 
	representations, identify clusters within network data, and simulate models with 
	varying clustering and connectivity patterns.
