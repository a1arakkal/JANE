**JANE** is an R package for fitting latent space network cluster models
using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. It enables flexible
modeling of unweighted or weighted network data, with or without noise
edges, and supports both directed and undirected networks, with or
without degree and strength heterogeneity. Designed to efficiently
handle large networks, **JANE** allows users to explore latent
structure, identify actor-centric communities, and simulate networks
with customizable clustering and connectivity patterns.

Details on the methodology underlying the package can be found
[here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2025.108228).

## Installation

``` r
# Current release from CRAN
install.packages("JANE")

# Development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("a1arakkal/JANE")
```

## Basic usage

### Simulate a network

``` r
library(JANE)
mus <- matrix(c(-1,-1,1,-1,1,1), 
              nrow = 3,
              ncol = 2, 
              byrow = TRUE)
omegas <- array(c(diag(rep(7,2)),
                  diag(rep(7,2)), 
                  diag(rep(7,2))), 
                  dim = c(2,2,3))
p <- rep(1/3, 3)
beta0 <- 1.0
sim_data <- JANE::sim_A(N = 100L, 
                        model = "NDH",
                        mus = mus, 
                        omegas = omegas, 
                        p = p, 
                        beta0 = beta0, 
                        remove_isolates = TRUE)
```

### Fit JANE on network

``` r
res <- JANE::JANE(A = sim_data$A,
                  D = 2L,
                  K = 3L,
                  initialization = "GNN", 
                  model = "NDH",
                  case_control = FALSE,
                  DA_type = "none")
```

### Summarize and plot fit

``` r

# Summarize fit 
summary(res)

# Plot network
plot(res)
```
