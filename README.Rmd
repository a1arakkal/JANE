JANE is a package to fit and simulate latent space network cluster models using an expectation-maximization algorithm.
Enables flexible modeling of unweighted network data, supporting both directed and undirected networks,
with or without degree heterogeneity. Designed to handle large networks efficiently, it allows users to explore 
network structure through latent space representations, identify clusters within network data, and simulate models
with varying clustering and connectivity patterns. 

## Installation

``` r
# Anticipated release from CRAN
# install.packages("JANE")

# Development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("a1arakkal/JANE")
```


## Basic usage

### Simulate a network

``` r
library(JANE)
mus <- matrix(c(-1,-1,1,-1,1,1), 
              nrow = 3,
              ncol = 2, 
              byrow = TRUE)
omegas <- array(c(diag(rep(7,2)),
                  diag(rep(7,2)), 
                  diag(rep(7,2))), 
                  dim = c(2,2,3))
p <- rep(1/3, 3)
beta0 <- 1.0
sim_data <- JANE::sim_A(N = 100L, 
                        model = "NDH",
                        mus = mus, 
                        omegas = omegas, 
                        p = p, 
                        beta0 = beta0, 
                        remove_isolates = TRUE)
```

### Fit JANE on network

``` r
res <- JANE::JANE(A = sim_data$A,
                  D = 2L,
                  K = 3L,
                  initialization = "GNN", 
                  model = "NDH",
                  case_control = FALSE,
                  DA_type = "none")
```

### Summarize and plot fit

``` r

# Summarize fit 
summary(res)

# plot network
plot(res)
```
